# CrackME 

Welcome to the CrackME challenge, designed to test your reverse engineering skills on the x86 architecture with advanced anti-debugging measures. This document provides a comprehensive guide to help you navigate and understand the features and protections implemented in this challenge.

## Features

- **Enhanced Anti-Debugging Measures**: The challenge includes robust anti-debugging techniques to detect and prevent reverse engineering attempts. These measures are designed to challenge even experienced reverse engineers and require creative thinking to bypass.

- **Interactive GUI**: Built using ImGui, the graphical user interface offers an engaging way to interact with the challenge. It features various interactive elements that provide hints and feedback as you progress through the challenge.

- **XOR String Encryption**: To protect sensitive strings such as window titles and process names used in anti-debugging checks, the challenge employs a custom XOR string encryption technique. This method ensures that strings are obfuscated in the binary, making it harder for reverse engineers to identify and bypass protections.

## Getting Started

To compile and run the CrackME challenge, follow these instructions:

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler that supports C++17 or later.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory and compile the source code using your preferred C++ compiler.
4. Run the compiled executable to start the challenge.

## Navigating the Challenge

The main goal of the CrackME challenge is to reverse engineer the binary and find the correct key to bypass the implemented protections. Pay close attention to the GUI elements and any feedback provided, as they may contain valuable hints.

Remember, the challenge is designed to be difficult and may require multiple attempts to solve. Use your reverse engineering skills to analyze the binary, understand the anti-debugging measures, and devise a strategy to find the correct key.

Good luck, and happy hacking!
